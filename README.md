Structor
========

## About

Structor is a simple library which helps you to build complex data structures.
In example if you want to provide the following JSON based on a SQL database:

```json
{
    "totalEntries": 2,
    "entries": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Foo",
            "isNew": true,
            "author": {
                "displayName": "Foo Bar",
                "uri": "http:\/\/phpsx.org"
            },
            "date": "2016-03-01T00:00:00+01:00",
            "links": {
                "self": "http:\/\/foobar.com\/news\/1"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "Bar",
            "isNew": true,
            "author": {
                "displayName": "Foo Bar",
                "uri": "http:\/\/phpsx.org"
            },
            "date": "2016-03-01T00:00:00+01:00",
            "links": {
                "self": "http:\/\/foobar.com\/news\/2"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To produce such an result we first need to get the data from the database. Today
most database libraries or ORMs are not designed to produce such nested results.
They either return a simple array or model objects in case of an ORM. Turning 
these results into the desired format is mostly no easy task.

Structor simplifies this process by providing a simple builder to create fully 
customizable responses. To produce the response above we could write the 
following code:

```php
use PSX\Structor\Field;
use PSX\Structor\Provider\PDO;
use PSX\Structor\Reference;

$provider = new PDO\Factory($pdo);

$definition = [
    'totalEntries' => 2,
    'entries' => $provider->newCollection('SELECT id, authorId, title, createDate FROM news ORDER BY createDate DESC', [], [
        'id' => 'id',
        'title' => new Field\Callback('title', function($title){
            return ucfirst($title);
        }),
        'isNew' => new Field\Value(true),
        'author' => $provider->newEntity('SELECT name, uri FROM author WHERE id = :id', ['id' => new Reference('authorId')], [
            'displayName' => 'name',
            'uri' => 'uri',
        ]),
        'date' => new Field\DateTime('createDate'),
        'links' => [
            'self' => new Field\Replace('http://foobar.com/news/{id}'),
        ]
    ])
];

$builder = new Builder();
$result  = $builder->build($definition));

// we can now i.e. json_encode the result
```

In this example it would be much more performant to simply join the author table
but the example should show how to handle nested queries.

Structor aims not to be a replacement for existing database or ORM libraries
instead it should be used in conjunction to produce complex data views.

## Concept

Structor uses a concept called providers. A provider is a simple class which 
either returns a collection or entity. Collection means it returns an array
which contains array entities. A entity means it returns a simple associative 
array containing the fields of the entity.

At the moment we have a PDO and Doctrine DBAL provider but it should be easy 
possible to writer providers for other systems. Feel free to send a pull 
request.
